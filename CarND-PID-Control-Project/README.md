## PID Control
PID controllers are simpe control-loop-feedback mechanism widely used in industrial applictions continuously modulated control. A PID controller continuously calculates an error value {\displaystyle e(t)} e(t) as the difference between a desired setpoint (SP) and a measured process variable (PV) and applies a correction based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms (denoted P, I, and D respectively) which give the controller its name. In simpler terms, it automaticaly applies a responsive and corrective measure to a control function.[Wikipedia Definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller). 

In the context of autonomous vehicles, the vehicle produces an error signal as the distance between the actual car position on the road and a reference trajectory (lane centreline), known as cross-track error (cte). The PID controller attempts to  minimize the cross track error by continuously applying a correction to the steering angle.

### P - Proportional Gain
The proportional gain component P in PID allows one to apply a correction to the control output proportional to the cross track error. While it allows the vehicle to steer in the right direction (direction of minimising the cross track error), a fixed proportional gain applied throughout the trip has tendency to overshoot the cross track error and oscillate the vehicle.

### D - Differential Gain
The differential gain allows the PID controller to take into account the rate of change of cross track error while applying a correction. It dampens the oscillation effect caused by proportional gain by acting as a countepart to the proportinal gain and allow the vehicle to follow a smooth trajectory.

### I - Integral gain 
The integral gain allows the PID controller to reduce the systematic bias by applying a correction based on accumulated cross track error over a period of time.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
I started optimisations with the systematiic twiddle approach as mentioned in lectures but the results were quickly lead to unrecoverable crashes of the car and required a manual restart of the simulator. At the end, I decided to take a simpler trial and error method as they helped gaining an intuitive understanding of the importance of different parameters and their contributions. The approach I roghly followed was: 

1. Start with  K_i and K_d = 0 , and gradually increase K_p to get a stable and consistent osciallting run
2. Increase K_d until oscillations subside
3. Apply the same process at different speed, in case of crashes
   a) Try reducing steering angle smoothing by increasing K_p or K_i to overcome slow reactivity
   b) Try reducing K_p, K_i and increasing K_d to overcome oscillations
   
The final parameters of K_p=0.15 , K_i=0, and K_d=2.5 gave decent results and were able to complete multiple tracks without crashing.

## Dependencies

  * If you run OSX and have homebrew installed you can just run the ./install-mac.sh script to install this
* Simulator. You can download these from the [project intro page](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/releases) in the classroom.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
