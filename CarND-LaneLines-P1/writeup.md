### 1. Lane Detection Pipeline
 I used the following steps to build the lane detection pipeline.
 Accompanying images show the result of operation of each step on input image
![Input Image][image1]
  
 1. Convert Image To Grayscale
![Grayscale][image2]
  
 2. Convert each image to HSV color space and create a mask to sample only yellow and white colors.
![HSV][image3]
![YelloWhiteMask][image4]
  
 3. Apply the mask from step 2 to grayscale image in step 1 by doing a bitwise and between both the images
![MaskedImage][image5]
 
 4. Apply Gaussian blur to uppress noise and spurious gradients and smooth the image for edge detection
 
 5. Use Canny edge detection to reduce the grayscale image to its edge outlines.
![Edges][image6]
 
 6. Simplify the image further by masking out any regions of the image that arenâ€™t likely to contain lane lines. 
Use a trapezoidal region of interest to mask out unwanted regions.
![MaskedEdges][image7]
 
 7. Apply a Hough Transform to the edges, which will return a collection of line segments wherever lines are detected.
![HoughLines][image8]

 8. Partition these line segments into left and right batches.
 9. For each batch, fit a single straight line to the segments and overlay onto the input image
![Output][image9]


In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function by sorting the 
hough lines into left and right lanes and then aggregating the left and right line candidates into left and right lanes
The process was as follows:

1. For each line in hough lines collection, calculate the slope and intercept of the line using the following equations.
   
   Slope m = (y2-y1)/(x2-x1)
   
   Intercept b = y1 - m * x1
   
2. Filter out all the vertical and horizontal lines by selecting lines having slope between 0.5 to 1.5
3. Label all the lines having positive slope as right lane candidates and negative slope as left lane candidates
4. Fit a 1-d polynomial to all points of right lane candidates and repeat it for left lane candidates to identify 
left and right lane equations.
5. Use the line equation from step 4 and the region of interest boundaries to form continuous left and right lane.
Each lane cane be drawn using just two points. One point for where the line crosses the bottom of the image 
(where y equals the image vertical size) and one for the point that corresponds to the collected data point that 
has max(x) or min(x) depending upon whether the line slope is positive or negative.
